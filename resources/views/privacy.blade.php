                <h2>L. Cookies</h2>

                <p>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.</p>

                <p>The names of the cookies that we use on our website, and the purposes for which they are used, are set out below:</p>

                    <li>we use Google Analytics on our website to recognize a computer when a user visits the website / track users as they navigate the website improve the website’s usability / analyze the use of the website / administer the website / prevent fraud and improve the security of the website;</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies—for example:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>in Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using the cookie handling override settings available by clicking “Tools,” “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and then “Advanced”;</li>
                    <li>in Firefox (version 24) you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Options,” “Privacy,” selecting “Use custom settings for history” from the drop-down menu, and unticking “Accept cookies from sites”; and</li>

                </ol>

                <p>Blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on our website.</p>
